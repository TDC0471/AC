Porting the project to WIN64 required download of newest versions of the required libraries.
There were conflicts - mainly with zlib/zlibwapi and SDL2_image - where LIB and DLL were mismatched. 
Also project specific ENET.LIB build required for ENET_CRC32_INC().
OpenAL-SOFT was not tested.
Suggestion: inspect e.g. Cube2:Tesseract and the WIN64 setup there.
